 * {@link com.vaadin.data.Container}s that connect to back-end resources because there is no equivalent of
 * {@link com.vaadin.ui.Component#attach()}/{@link com.vaadin.ui.Component#detach()} like there is for widgets.
 * Typically, {@link #connect} and {@link #disconnect} (respectively) would be invoked by those methods.
