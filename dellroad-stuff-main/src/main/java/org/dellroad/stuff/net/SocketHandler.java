     * <p>
     * In any case, it is important that {@link #handleConnection handleConnection()} thread does eventually return,
     * otherwise the thread invoking {@link SocketAcceptor#stop SocketAcceptor.stop()} will hang.

     * <p>
     * Note: it may be that {@link #handleConnection handleConnection()} has already returned when this method is invoked,
