/**
 * Manages a delayed action without race conditions.
 *
 * <p>
 * A "delayed action" is a some action that needs to get done by some time in the future.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class does two things:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>It collapses multiple attempts to schedule the action into a single scheduled action,
 *  i.e., at most one outstanding scheduled action can exist at a time.</li>
 *  <li>It provides a race-free and 100% reliable way to {@link #cancel} a future scheduled action, if any.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The action itself is defined by the subclass' implementation of {@link #run run()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * To avoid races, this class requires the user to supply a <i>locking object</i>. This may either be a normal
 * Java object, in which case normal Java synchronization is used, or a {@link Lock} object. The locking object is
 * used to serialize scheduling activity and action invocation. In other words, the locking object is locked during
 * the execution of {@link #schedule schedule()}, {@link #cancel cancel()}, and {@link #run run()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Therefore, any time the locking object is locked, the state of this {@link DelayedAction} instance is "frozen"
 * in one of three states: not scheduled, scheduled, or executing (in the latter case, of course the thread doing the
 * executing is the one holding the lock). Therefore, to completely avoid race conditions, user code must <i>itself</i>
 * lock the locking object itself prior to invoking any methods in this class.
 *
 * <p>
 * Typically the most convenient locking object to use is the user's own {@code this} object, which can be locked using a
 * {@code synchronized} method or block.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: in the case that {@link #run run()} invokes {@link Object#wait Object.wait()} on the locking object, thereby
 * temporarily releasing the lock, to any other methods in this class it will appear as if that execution has already
 * completed.
