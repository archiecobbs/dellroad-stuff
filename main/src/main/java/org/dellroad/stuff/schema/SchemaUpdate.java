 * A one-time database schema update. Instances typically perform changes to the database schema, though non-schema updates
 * that just manipulate the data in the database are perfectly valid as well.
 *

 * Each {@link SchemaUpdate} has a unique name among all updates ever applied to a single database, and zero
 * or more required predecessors, which are other dependent updates that must be applied first.
 *
 * <p>
 * Once an update has been applied to a database, it must not be changed; otherwise, inconsistencies
 * can exist between databases that were updated using the old version vs. databases that were
 * updated using the new version. If an update has been applied but had the wrong behavior, instead of
 * changing the update, it's better to create a new update that depends on the first as a predecessor
 * and corrects the mistake.
 *
 * <p>
 * If you do have to change an update after it has been applied, then those databases that have
 * already seen the previous version of the update must be manually corrected so they are in the
 * same state that the new version of the update would have left them.
