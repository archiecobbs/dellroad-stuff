/**
 * Interface for atomic storage and retrieval of an opaque byte array, with access being done
 * via {@link InputStream} and {@link OutputStream} interfaces.
 *
 * <p>
 * Conceptually, there is a single underlying byte array. Instances behave as if an atomic readable snapshot
 * is made when {@link #getInputStream} is invoked, and the results of that snapshot are then available
 * in the returned {@link InputStream}. Similarly, instances behave as if the underlying byte array is
 * atomically updated when the output stream returned by {@link #getOutputStream} is successfully
 * {@linkplain OutputStream#close closed}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Instances are thread safe, and support multiple concurrent open input and output streams. In particular,
 * two output streams may be {@linkplain OutputStream#close closed} at the same time by two different threads,
 * and one will always win the race.
