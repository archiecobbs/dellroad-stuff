/**
 * Support superclass for clients that want to maintain a persistent connection to some server.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is suitable for use with any abstract notion of "client", "server", and "connection". Typically
 * it would be used to maintain a persistent connection to a remote server over the network. This class
 * mainly serves to implement the connection state machine, including an exponential back-off retry timer,
 * subclass notifications for state transitions, and guaranteed thread safety.
 *
 * <p>
 * Each instance has a dedicated thread that manages the connection and performs any required work while connected.
 * The lifecycle of a connection is delimited by calls (by this thread) to the subclass methods
 * {@link #createConnection createConnection()} and {@link #cleanupConnection cleanupConnection()}.
 * The actual per-connection work is performed by {@link #handleConnection handleConnection()}.
 * Each connection has an associated connection context (defined by the subclass) and passed to these methods.
 *
 * <p>
 * The subclass is also notified of state machine transitions via the state transition methods
 * {@link #started started()}, {@link #stopped stopped()}, {@link #connectionSuccessful connectionSuccessful()},
 * {@link #connectionFailed connectionFailed()}, and {@link #connectionEnded connectionEnded()};
 * all of these methods are invoked by the background thread.
